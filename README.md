# A-COBIT-2019-Risk-Assessment-Approach
A Risk Assessment approach based on COBIT 2019.

*(Under development)* This simple program<sup>1</sup>, uses an own methodology (based on: https://github.com/Lucho-A/A-Risk-Assessment-approach-based-on-Information-Theory) for evaluating and priorizing COBIT 2019 processes. It intends to be a tool for, mainly, evaluate the engagements to be included in an Annual IT Audit Plan.

Some features:
- Because the concept of probability is so much align with controls instead of processes, the "inherent" risk associated is only in line with the different impacts of the processes, this is: information impact, financial/economical impact, and others (compliance impact, for example).
- It takes into consideration not only the result of the latest evaluation (in order to evaluate the residual risk) but, also, the aging (the elapsed period) between the date of the latest revision and the current day.
- It defines a value (risk exposure) as the cocient between the residual risk and the impact expressed in bits/impact (this is, how much information I have per impact unit. Less value, less information I have and, in consequence, these processes could be considered to be included in an Annual IT Audit Plan).

<sub><sup>1</sup> The screenshot is only an example with a reduced set of processes.</sub>
